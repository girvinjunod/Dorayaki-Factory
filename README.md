# Dorayaki Factory
This repository consists of the server, client, and web service of our dorayaki factory program. The dorayaki factory program provides a way for the dorayaki factory to handle logistic request from dorayaki stores through the web service of our dorayaki factory. The web service uses a SOAP protocol and the dorayaki stores can send request through the endpoints given to them. The request will be passed to the factory server, which will then store the request data. There's also a client for the factory admin to use to manage the dorayaki supplies. The admin can then use the client to see and update the supplies of dorayaki ingredients and recipes. They can also see the list of requests from stores and choose to accept or decline the request. All of these actions are sent to the server which will then process it. The dorayaki stores can then check the status of their request through the web service.
